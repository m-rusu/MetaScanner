# MetaScanner

This program can be used for scanning a file against the **metadefender.opswat.com** API.

## Usage

Easy usage: you can either only download **scanner\bin\Release\net8.0\win-x64\publish** folder or entire repo and follow the same path.

Open publish folder in powershell or cmd and **run** using the following command: **.\scanner.exe "<file-path>" "<api-key>"**



If you want to modify the code, publish using **dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained** and run again the command from above.
